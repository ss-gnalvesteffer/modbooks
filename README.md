## Building the project and packaging it for distribution
- Open the solution file `src/Books/Books.sln`.
- Change the file paths of the `VintagestoryAPI` and `VSEssentials` dll references for the `Books` project to point to the ones in your environment.
- Build the project.
- The mod content will be copied to the build output directory, and you can then rename and zip the folder.
